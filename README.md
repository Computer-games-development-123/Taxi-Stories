### 1. **Game Concept**

Taxi Stories turns a simple driving job into an exploration of human connections. As the player picks up different passengers across Tel Aviv, they must navigate traffic, manage time, and make choices that affect how people react and how the story evolves.

### 2. **Gameplay Mechanics**

* **Core Loop:** Pick up passenger → Drive safely → Engage in dialogue → Choose responses → Earn money/reputation → Upgrade taxi.
* **Player Stats:**

  * **Reputation:** Affected by politeness, driving style, and dialogue tone.
  * **Money:** Earned from rides; used for car upgrades or maintenance.
  * **Energy:** Depletes with long shifts; resting restores focus.

### 3. **Game Systems and Challenges**

* **Driving System:** Realistic city map with traffic rules, pedestrians, and random events (e.g., traffic jams, police checks).
* **Dialogue System:** Branching conversations where tone and timing matter.
* **Passenger Generator:** Each day spawns new passengers with randomized backgrounds and moods.

### 4. **Examples of Passengers and Scenarios**

* **Scenario 1:** A soldier on weekend leave – tired, quiet, but opens up if you play soft music.
* **Scenario 2:** A tourist lost in the city – speaks in broken English, giving opportunities for funny miscommunication.
* **Scenario 3:** An elderly woman visiting the hospital – the player can choose to comfort her or stay professional.
* **Scenario 4:** A businessman in a rush – if you take a shortcut, you risk a ticket but earn his gratitude.

### 5. **Aesthetic and Art Style**

* Semi-realistic 3D graphics with colorful Tel Aviv landmarks (Dizengoff, Rothschild, the beach promenade).
* Ambient lighting reflecting mood and weather.
* Background sounds: honking, radios, street chatter.

### 6. **Market Research**

* Similar Games: *Night Call*, *Neo Cab*, *Crazy Taxi*, *Firewatch* (dialogue system inspiration).
* Target Audience: Players who enjoy story-driven simulations and moral choice games.
* Unique Value: Combines Israeli culture and humor with relatable life stories.
